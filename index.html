                <h2 style="color: #41a4dc">1. Leave the Fireworks Display to the Experts</h2>
                <p>
                    The Fourth of July falls during fire season in Arizona, making fireworks hazardous to the landscape. They have <a style="color: #41a4dc" href="https://dffm.az.gov/fireworks-and-fire-danger">caused large fires</a> in Arizona in the past. Stick to the legal fireworks like ground spinners, flitter sparklers, and ground sparkling devices. Be sure to only light fireworks in the allotted times of June 24th through July 6th. As the laws may be updated, be sure to check what the <a style="color: #41a4dc" href="https://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/01606.htm">current regulations</a> are.
                </p><p>   
                    Remember to be mindful. From a mental health perspective, fireworks can cause many people anxiety or even trigger one’s PTSD. Also, many people with mental health problems are triggered by large crowds. Holidays like Independence day could cause sensory overload for some, so recognizing these triggers can help you or someone else celebrate in a healthier state of mind.</p>

                    <li> shade or going inside during the hottest parts of the day</li>
                    <li>Keeping your food either hot or cold, depending on the conditions that make it safe to eat</li>
                    <li>Keeping children close</li>

                <p>
                    Avoiding alcohol and drugs when you celebrate Independence Day is especially important if you are in recovery or if you or a loved one are in danger of becoming addicted.

                    <li>Understand mental health issues such as difficulty coping that lead to your drinking and seek help if the holidays bring up bad feelings</li>
                    <li>Reduce your temptations by avoiding places where there are few other sober people to socialize with</li>
                    <li>Take advantage of your support network by staying close to friends and family who understand your struggles</li>
                    <li> tasty backup beverages on hand that you truly enjoy, even if it means indulging a little with a soda or slushy</li>
                    <li>Create a backup plan to exit your situation quickly and without problems if your surroundings are challenging your sobriety or mental health</li>
